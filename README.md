# ![wmc-logo](webMidiConductor/favicon.ico) webmidi-conductor
JavaScript library for interpreting midi messages and audits live performance. Determines if notes being played are in the desired scale along with indicating each note's scale degree. It also indicates what chords are being played and if a good chord progression has occurred. 

It comes with a free demo wallball pong-esque game. [Click Here to Play!](https://www.pauljuneauengineer.com/webmidi-conductor/)

### Other applications of webmidi-conductor
* https://github.com/pauljuneau/wmc-game-phaser-poc
# Development Features
## wallball game demo features
* Cross platform compatible (Android, PC, Mac).
   * iPhones are unable to use the live audio feature. Please connect a midi device or a computer keyboard instead. 
      * midi input devices such as a digital piano have yet to tested on iPhones. Please submit an issue if there is a midi input device compatibility problem and please provide details about the phone's iOS and model. Thank you!  
* Resizes to fit mobile screen.
* Can choose to enable Live audio to interpret sound as pitch events increasing or decreasing to move paddle up or down.
   * Consumes pitch JavaScript events produced by [PitchDetectMirror](https://github.com/pauljuneau/PitchDetectMirror).
## webmidi-conductor JavaScript repo features
* Compatible with any midi instrument and browser that works with the https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MIDIAccess.
* Real-time scale detection based on desired scale.
   * Can print note name played, scale degree ascending/descending, and chord being played (chord detection not enabled for live audio).
   * Compatible Scales:
      *  major, natural minor, melodic minor, harmonic minor, minor pentatonic, major pentatonic, major blues, minor blues, major bepop, minor bepop, dorian mode, phrygian mode, lydian mode, mixolydian mode, aeolian mode, and locrian mode.
   * Compatible Chords:
      * Triads: Major, Minor, Augmented, Diminished
      * 7ths: Major, Minor, Dominant, Minor 7th flat 5, Diminished, Minor-major 
* Real-time chord progression detection based on common Major or Minor progressions. Custom progressions can be introduced programatically. 
* Can use computer keyboard as simple piano:
   
   Computer Keyboard Key | Note Name | Midi Number
   ------------ | ------------- | -------------
   A | C (middle C) | 60
   W | C#/Db | 61
   S | D | 62
   E | D#/Eb | 63
   D | E | 64
   F | F | 65
   T | F#/Gb | 66
   G | G | 67
   Y | G#/Ab | 68
   H | A | 69
   U | A#/Bb | 70
   J | B | 71
   K | C | 72
   O | C#/Db | 73
   L | D | 74
   P | D#/Eb | 75
   ; | E | 76
   ' | F | 77
   ] | F#/Gb | 78  
   Spacebar | Sustain Pedal | N/A 

   * In the game demo, piano sounds are emulated from the keyboard input via games/demo/sounds and played by initiating the `play()` function on the hidden html `audio` tags. See [this code example](#listening-for-midi-instrumentation-events) on how to play piano sounds when playing on the computer keyboard.

## GitHub jsDelivr CDN
webmidi-conductor, WMC, is available via jsDeliv GitHub. To get WMC at a specific release then these 2 tags can be added in the following order. See https://www.jsdelivr.com/?docs=gh for more ways to attain javascript code from github.
```
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/pauljuneau/webmidi-conductor@2.5.1/webMidiConductor/midiChlorianController.js"></script>
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/pauljuneau/webmidi-conductor@2.5.1/webMidiConductor/musicConductorCtrl.js"></script>
```

## Enabling the webmidi music conductor 
The webmidi music conductor can continously run in the background to identify notes being played, their relationship with respect to the context scale, and detections of chords playing along with identifying chord progressions.
```
switchOnOffMusicalPerformance(100);
```

## Listening for MidiInstrumentationEvents
MidiInstrumentationEvents are dispatched which can be listened for and subsequently actioned upon such as playing piano sounds when playing on your computer keyboard or moving your character in a game.

```
document.addEventListener(MidiInstrumentationEvents.MIDICHLORIANCTRLEVENT, function(e) {
   const oneMidiChlorianCtrlrEvent = JSON.parse(e.value);
   
   //Play Piano Sounds when playing on computer keyboard
   if(oneMidiChlorianCtrlrEvent.midiInputPlaying.eventType == 'KEYBOARD') {
      try {
         document.getElementById(oneMidiChlorianCtrlrEvent.midiInputPlaying.noteName).play();
      } catch (e) {
         console.error(e.name + ': '+e.message);
      }
   }
   
   //example code to perform an action after player has played up or down in the register
   if(oneMidiChlorianCtrlrEvent.countIncreased) {
      //do something when the player played up in the register
    } else if ( oneMidiChlorianCtrlrEvent.countDecreased ) {
      //do something when the player played down in the register
    } else {
      //do something when the player did not go up or down in the register
    }
}

```

Do the following to stop piano sounds being played when they are no longer being played on the computer keyboard
```
document.addEventListener(MidiInstrumentationEvents.NOTELASTPLAYED, function(e){
  const oneNoteLastPlayed = JSON.parse(e.value);
  if(oneNoteLastPlayed.eventType == 'KEYBOARD') {
    try {
      document.getElementById(oneNoteLastPlayed.noteName).pause();
    } catch (e) {
      console.error(e.name + ': '+e.message);
    }
  }
});
```
