# Wall Ball Game Demo Overview

## Setup 

* Plug in your midi instrument (e.g. piano) to your computer or smartphone prior to accessing the game demo site via link above.  

## Rules

* Playing up or down in pitch causes paddle to move up or down.
* Paddle will shrink if not playing within the designated scale.
* Goals are 10 points 
* Triad chords are 3 points & 7ths are 4.
* Wall color is based on the defined key's position on a RGB Circle of 5ths Color Wheel.
   * In the major key: C is red, E is green, and G# (Ab) is blue.
* When chord is played, paddle will change color to related chord's key mapped to RGB Circle of 5ths Color where C chords are red, E chords are green, and G# (Ab) chords are blue.
